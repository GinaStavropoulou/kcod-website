Geomatics for the Built Environment provides vital spatial knowledge about the built environment. The science Geomatics is concerned with the acquisition, analysis, management and visualisation of geographic data with the aim of gaining knowledge and a better understanding of the built and natural environments. The programme at  the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of TU Delft differs from other Geomatics programmes in its broad and interdisciplinary nature and technical depth and its close connection to the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.

The remote sensing techniques that students will learn in this programme, give them the ability to measure and observe our environment and especially the features that are beyond the capability of the human eye. Data management and analysis techniques allow students to turn these measurements into useful information and knowledge, with which patterns can be identified, behaviour over time can be tracked and the future state can be predicted. Students will apply your skills in 3D modelling, GIS, mapping, serious gaming, simulation and visualisation to a wide range of fields, such as disaster management, geodesign, location-based services (LBS) and land administration. Also applications as real time mapping, promoting energy efficiency and investigating and analysing the movement of people belong to the possibilities.

 

GEO1009: Geo-information Organisation and Legislation (5ECTS)

In the information age, information has become of vital importance to the economic and social development of a country. Especially geographic information is of increasing importance for the successful execution of (public and private) tasks. Professors Onsrud and Rushton convincingly argue that “The value of information comes from its use”. Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) facilitate the collection, maintenance, dissemination, and use of geographic information. By reducing duplication, facilitating integration and developing new and innovative applications, and respecting user needs, SDIs can produce significant human and resource savings and returns and performance gains of both public task and private tasks.

The legal and organisational frameworks are important for the successful use of geographic information. Think about the intellectual property rights such as copyright and the database right, the right to access public data, and the need to respect the privacy frameworks in using data. Also one should bear in mind that the collection, and processing of geographic data requires significant human and financial resources. It is therefore imperative that the geo-processes are organised as efficient as possible: collect it once use it many times. Not only each single organisation is stimulated to adhere to this principle, also at a national, regional (European Union) and global level this would result in significant societal benefits.

However, the needs of communities change over time. While technology may fulfil the new needs, these are often not anticipated by outdated legislation and inflexible organisational structures. Also we have seen an increased role for citizens in the SDI processes. This volunteered geographic information adds a new dimension to traditional structures of cooperation and data exchange.

The Geo-information Organisation and Legislation course provides the key legislative frameworks applying to geographic information and addresses the organisational challenges practitioners may be confronted with when working with geo-information within and between organisations, countries and regions.
