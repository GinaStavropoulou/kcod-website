On the 10th of February, the Department of Urbanism held its first Research Exchange Meeting dedicated to “inclusive urbanism”. The event was coordinated by Stefano Calzati, together with Thomas Verbeek and Marcin Dubrowski, and it hosted presentations of early-launched and ongoing research projects, one for each of the six sections animating the department. For the Urban Data Science group, Ashraf Shaharudin presented the [ODECO project](https://odeco-research.eu/), in which he is currently involved and which is coordinated by Bastiaan van Loenen. The event included workshop cross-sectional discussions, attended by a robust representation of PhDs, postdocs, professors, and department staff.
